# KMeans Clustering Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **KMeans Clustering Algorithm** using Python and the `sklearn` library. It includes data preprocessing, choosing optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method, model training, and visualizing the results with insights.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Structure

- `KMeans_Clustering.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing full KMeans implementation and insights.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- What is Clustering?
- KMeans Clustering Algorithm
- Elbow Method to determine optimal `k`
- Cluster Visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

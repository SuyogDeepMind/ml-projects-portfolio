# AdaBoost Classifier Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm using Python. The goal is to build a robust binary classification model leveraging ensemble learning techniques. The notebook includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights.

## 🔍 Project Structure

- **EDA**: Understanding the dataset via univariate and bivariate visualizations.
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding, scaling, and data splitting.
- **Model Building**: Implementing AdaBoost Classifier using `scikit-learn`.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and more.
- **Conclusion**: Insights gained from the AdaBoost performance.

## 📁 Files

- `Adaboost.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with code and results.

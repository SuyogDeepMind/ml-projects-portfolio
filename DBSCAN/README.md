# 📊 DBSCAN Clustering Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** using Python. DBSCAN is an unsupervised clustering algorithm particularly well-suited for discovering clusters in datasets with noise and varying density.

---

## ✅ Objective

To apply DBSCAN on a dataset to:
- Identify clusters in a non-linearly separable dataset
- Visualize cluster formation
- Understand the impact of parameters `eps` and `min_samples`
- Handle noise/outliers effectively

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- `scikit-learn` – for DBSCAN model
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` – for visualization
- `numpy` and `pandas` – for data handling

---

## 📁 Files

- `DBSCAN.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing all code and results

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- What is DBSCAN?
- Choosing the right `eps` and `min_samples`
- Comparing DBSCAN with KMeans
- Visualizing clusters and noise points
- Distance plot for parameter tuning

---

## 📊 Outputs

- Cluster assignments
- Visual cluster plots
- Noise point detection
- Comparison with other clustering techniques (optional)

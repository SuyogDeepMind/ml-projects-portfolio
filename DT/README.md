# ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Classifier - Practical Machine Learning Project

This project presents an end-to-end implementation of the **Decision Tree Classifier** using real-world data. It demonstrates the workflow of a typical machine learning projectâ€”from data exploration and preprocessing to model training, visualization, and evaluation.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To understand how Decision Trees work in classification problems by:
- Visualizing decision boundaries
- Evaluating model accuracy
- Interpreting tree splits and overfitting

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- Training a Decision Tree classifier using `scikit-learn`
- Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., `max_depth`, `criterion`)
- Visualizing the decision tree structure
- Model performance evaluation using:
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report

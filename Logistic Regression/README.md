# Logistic Regression - Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Logistic Regression**, a fundamental classification algorithm used in Machine Learning, using a real-world dataset. The notebook walks through data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and provides insights at each stage.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
To predict a binary outcome (0 or 1) based on the input features using Logistic Regression. The objective is to learn the relationship between features and the binary target using a sigmoid function.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset is loaded using `pandas.read_csv()` and is assumed to be structured in tabular format with a binary target column.

## âœ… Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**
2. **Load the Dataset**
3. **Data Exploration (EDA)**
4. **Data Preprocessing**
5. **Train-Test Split**
6. **Model Training using Logistic Regression**
7. **Model Evaluation using Confusion Matrix and Classification Report**
8. **Insights and Explanation throughout the notebook**

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- Sigmoid Function:  
  \[
  \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
  \]

- Cost Function (Binary Cross-Entropy):
  \[
  J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum \left[ y \log(\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y}) \right]
  \]

- Model Evaluation Metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

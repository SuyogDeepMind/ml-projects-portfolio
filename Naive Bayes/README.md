# Naive Bayes Classifiers in Machine Learning

This repository contains implementations and demonstrations of the three main types of Naive Bayes classifiers:

- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** – for binary/boolean features
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes** – for continuous/normally distributed features
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** – for discrete count-based features (like word counts)

These notebooks are designed to help beginners understand how each variant works, along with practical examples and evaluation metrics.

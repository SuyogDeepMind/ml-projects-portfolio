# Gradient Boosting Classifier - End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow using **Gradient Boosting Classifier**. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Cleaned and preprocessed data for model training
- 📊 Performed EDA with univariate and bivariate visualizations
- 🚀 Implemented Gradient Boosting Classifier using `scikit-learn`
- 🎯 Evaluated model performance with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix
- 🔍 Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV (if included)
- 📈 Visualized feature importances and model performance
